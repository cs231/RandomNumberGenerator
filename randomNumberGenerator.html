<h2>Random Number generator</h2>

<pre><b style="font-size: 15px"> rand( )</b> returns a random positive integer in the range from 0 to 32,767. <br>
 This function can be thought of as rolling a die with 32,767 faces.  The numbers are generated by a<br> mathematical algorithm which when given a starting number (called the "seed"), always generates the same <br>sequence of numbers.  Since the same sequence is generated each time the seed remains the same, the rand( )<br> function generates a pseudo-random sequence.  To prevent the same sequence from being generated each time, use<br>
 <b style="font-size: 15px">srand(x)</b> to change the seed value.

 <b style="font-size: 15px">srand(x)</b> used to set the starting value (seed) for generating a sequence of pseudo-random integer values.<br>  The srand(x) function sets the seed of the random number generator algorithm used by the function rand( ).<br>  A seed value of 1 is the default setting yielding the same sequence of values as if srand(x) were not used. <br>  Any other value for the seed produces a different sequence.

Using
srand(time(NULL));
makes use of the computer's internal clock to control the choice of the seed.  Since time is continually changing, the seed is forever changing.<br>  Remember, if the seed number remains the same, the sequence of numbers will be repeated for each run of the program. <br>

 

Generating random numbers within a specified range:
  In order to produce random integer numbers within a specified range, you need to manipulate the rand( ) function. 
 The formula is:

int number = a + rand( ) % n;

a = the first number in your range
n = the number of terms in your range
(range computed by  largest value - smallest value + 1)

 

 

Sample program:

/*generate 10 random numbers between 10 and 55 inclusive, without repetition of the sequence between program runs*/

#include&lt;iostream&gt;
#include&lt;cstdlib&gt;
#include&lt;ctime&gt;

int main(void)
{
     // to prevent sequence repetition between runs     
     srand(time(NULL));  

  
     for(int i = 1; i <=10; i++)     // looping to print 10 numbers
     {
           cout<< 10 + rand( ) % 46;   // formula for numbers 
     }

     return 0;
}
